## Installation

You'll first need to install [ESLint](http://eslint.org):

```
$ npm i eslint --save-dev
```

Next, install `eslint-plugin-stedi-aws-rules`:

```
$ npm install eslint-plugin-stedi-aws-rules --save-dev
```

## Usage

Add `stedi` to the plugins section of your `.eslintrc` configuration file. You can omit the `eslint-plugin-` prefix:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@stedi/stedi-aws-rules"]
}
```

Then configure the rules you want to use under the rules section.

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "@stedi/stedi-aws-rules/no-aws-import": "error",
    "@stedi/stedi-aws-rules/instrument-aws-clients": "error",
    "@stedi/stedi-aws-rules/instrument-document-clients": "error"
  }
}
```
